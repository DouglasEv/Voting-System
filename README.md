# Voting-System
A solution that will enable citizens to vote online in a secured and verifiable way which will enable a reduction in the listed burdens as well as provide a high level of accuracy and efficiency in both determinations of the results and providing a reduction in spoilt or invalid votes.


Project breakdown
The project will be broken into two modules, each group will take on one of these modules, this means interaction must take place between the groups to deliver a satisfactory solution – providing APIs and working on common database etc:
1. Administration and Results:
Electoral Roll
Constituencies/Regions
Candidates
Publish Interim Results – Graphs/Charts
Publish Final Result
2. Voting:
Registration
Identity
Ballot Paper
Submit Results – Ensure only once!
Ensure results can be decoupled from electoral role (identity) after election but keep demographics with results (Age, Gender etc)
